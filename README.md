# AI-Driven Anomaly Detection in Cloud Infrastructure

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI-powered system for **real-time anomaly detection** in cloud infrastructure, focusing specifically on **Express.js server logs**. Leveraging a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** deep learning model, the system continuously monitors incoming server logs to detect unusual patterns or potential security threats such as **DDoS attacks**, **brute force attempts**, and other anomalies.

By automating log analysis, the system enables immediate threat detection and automated alert generation, reducing the need for manual log inspection and improving overall cloud security.

## üö® Problem Statement

- **Cloud Security Vulnerabilities**  
  Cloud systems face increasing numbers of cyberattacks, demanding more robust and automated security solutions.

- **Real-Time Detection Gaps**  
  Traditional security tools often struggle with real-time detection of evolving threats.

- **Manual Monitoring Inefficiency**  
  Manual log inspection is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable for large datasets typical of cloud environments.

## ‚úÖ AI-Powered Solution

### Data Source  
- Continuously collect logs from an **Nginx server hosting an Express.js application on AWS EC2**.

### AI Model  
- Uses a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** deep learning model trained on historical log data for anomaly detection.

### Alerts  
- Automated alerts are triggered upon detection of suspicious activity for immediate response.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Training**  
   - Collected ~1000 rows of attack-related log data for model training.

2. **Log Collection**  
   - Real-time logs are streamed from the Express application.

3. **Model Inference**  
   - Logs are analyzed in real-time by the RAG model to detect anomalies.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Results are displayed on a web interface for easy interpretation.

5. **Alerts**  
   - Automated alerts notify the security team when threats are detected.
